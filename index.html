  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>My favorite part of school is Latinos in action. The reason being I get to go
    to an elementary and help teachers out. I get to help students with what they are
    struggling on. The class is also useful because it helps me learn about real world problems. </p>
  <p>My life is not that interesting but some of my favorite things to do are painting, taking my dog
    for a walk, and playing games with my cousins. I have a brother who I will start working with soon
    and my sister who’s in college. My parents are the best my mom always refuses to make food that is
     literally the best. My dog Beethoven is four years old and decided that he is every animal but a dog.</p>
